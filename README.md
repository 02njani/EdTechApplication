Imagine a world where every choice you make comes with feedback. That's exactly what our game, World of Choices, offers for children aged 5 to 7. In this captivating journey, kids encounter everyday scenarios, such as resolving conflict or getting along with others, where they are faced with multiple choices. They have the ability to make any decision they want, after which a friendly pet will guide them with moral insights on making the right decisions. With each choice, children will witness the associated outcomes, learning valuable lessons in empathy and communication. The game provides a safe space for children to practice necessary social skills, preparing them for real world interactions and promoting positive relationships. World of Choices isn't just about playing, it's about empowering little ones with life skills theyâ€™ll carry into adulthood.
