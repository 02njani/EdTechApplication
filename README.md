In this game, World of Choices, children (most suitable for children ages 5 - 7) encounter everyday scenarios, such as resolving conflict or getting along with others. They can make any decision they want, after which a friendly pet will guide them with moral insights on making the right decisions. Children can  witness the associated outcomes and learn valuable lessons in empathy and communication. The game provides a safe space for children to practice necessary social skills, preparing them for real-world interactions and promoting positive relationships.
